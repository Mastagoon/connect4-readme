# Github readme connect-4


This is an open connect4 game ANYONE can play. This project is inspired by [this template](https://github.com/marcizhu/readme-chess).
It uses github actions to trigger the script when a new issue opens, which in turn updates the board and closes the issue.
You can try it out right now on [my profile](https://github.com/mastagoon).

To play, click on any of the numbers at the bottom of the board.
